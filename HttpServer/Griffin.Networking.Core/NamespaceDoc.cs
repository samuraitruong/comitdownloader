    /// Griffin.Networking is a networking layer built on top of the new socket <c>Async</c> methods. The library contains buffer management, socket management, message encoding/decoding and a pipeline implemention. i.e. basically everything that you need to create your own socket application.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>We currently also have two implemented protocols: HTTP and Basic. Basic is a small encoder/decoder which allows you to transport objects other the network (transported as JSON) without you having to do any socket coding.</para>
